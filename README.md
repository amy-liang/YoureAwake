Are you awake yet? You're Awake knows you are.

## What it does
As a submission for TerribleHacks X, a hack-a-thon where the goal is to make the most meaningless, perhaps even most useless thing you can (that is also exciting and cultivates learning). Thus, You're Awake was born. Are you awake? Well, the You're Awake app knows you are! Once you've come to your senses in the morning, what better way to start off your day by letting You're Awake play an obnoxiously annoying alarm? Choose from a variety of horrible meme sounds including the 20th Century Theme Flute Version, Toxic by Britney Spears ShittyFlute, the Gopher Scream and more!

## What we learned
Github and git was a huge part of this project since we had 4 group members. We all worked on different aspects, and were able to push and commit updates directly from Android Studios. I mostly worked on front end aspects like the application layout and button functions. I also learned about interacting with different views through Java.
